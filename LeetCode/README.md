# LC challenges
### Incorrect-Solutions
Did not solve the problem, but approach is still valuable.

### Time-limit-exceeded
Solves the problem, but too inefficient to run through all test datasets.

### Successful-Solutions
Solves the problem, and efficient enough to run through all test datasets.

### Items to review:
-Time efficiency for Max consecutive ones III

# Lesson progress:
### Arrays 101: 3 of 6 (In Progress)
-Introduction Follow-up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?
Examples:
--the time taken for insertion at the beginning of an Array will be proportional to the length of the Array, since each element needs to be shifted to the right. Linear time complexity is O(N), where  N is the length of the Array.
--same applies for deleting at the beginning of an Array... every element all the way to the last one will be shifted one place to the left.

-Inserting-to-arrays Follow-up: 20210702-Merge-Sorted-Array.py is pretty messy, although its speed is pretty fast. Is there a more simple/elegant way to write this?
